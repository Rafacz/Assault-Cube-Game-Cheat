#### I've decided to stop developing this application. I'm planning in the future to create cheat for more popular game with anticheat bypass. There is still alot of things i have to learn first.

DrawRectangle is still seeking for my attention as its not drawing correctly at certain distance. ESP will work correctly on 1280x768 game resolution.

Things that could be done in this project.
  - Edit math (ESP - Rectangle size)
  - Fix flicker using doublebuffer
  - ~~Health bars~~
  - ~~Line pointing enemy~~
  - ~~Radar~~
  - ~~Nicknames~~


All memory addresses were retrieved using Cheat Engine for game version 1.2.0.2

To read and write process memory I've used VAMemory DLL but same results can be achieved using win32 api functions.


Feel free to test this application.
