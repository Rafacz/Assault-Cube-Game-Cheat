# Assault Cube cheat application

## This application is simple aimlock and ESP overlay.

DrawRectangle is still seeking for my attention as its not drawing correctly at certain distance. ESP will work correctly on 1280x768 resolution.

Future plans for this application.
  - Edit math
  - ~~Add health bars~~
  - ~~Line pointing enemy position~~
  - Radar
  - ~~Nicknames~~
  - Fix rectangle size.
  - Fix flickering using doublebuffer


All memory addresses were retrieved using Cheat Engine for game version 1.2.0.2

To read and write process memory I've used VAMemory DLL but same results can be achieved using win32 api functions.


Feel free to test this application.
